            <p>One of the things we pride ourselves on the most is our process and part of this process is the 
                products we use. We use a biodegradable pre-wash that is completely safe and will not damage your 
                siding, grass, soil, pets, or anything else you may have outside. We also use extender poles with a 
                micro-fiber brush that will not scratch or damage any of your siding and will instead get into 
                all of the groves and give it a full clean.
